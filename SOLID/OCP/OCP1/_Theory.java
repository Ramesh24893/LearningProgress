//---------------------------------OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPE----------------------------
// SOFTWARE ENTITIES (CLASSES,MODULES,FUNCTION) SHOULD BE OPEN FOR EXTENSION AND CLOSED FOR MODIFICATION
// If a application is created and it is in best condition and I give it to the customer
//In future if a customer want to add new features in the application
//I need to add new feature without changing the existing code
//If a change is made it will collapse the entire program
//---------------------------
// ABSTRACTION is the key to implement OCP
//We need to create an abstraction layer by predicting what customer will ask to do
