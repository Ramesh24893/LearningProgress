//----------------------------INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE-------------------
//We should not be force the users to depend upon interfaces that they do not use
//This principle helps how to create interface instead of creating a interface with lot of functionalities
//Violation of ISP leads to violation of Single Responsibility principle
//maintenance becomes harder
//Client developers are confused by the methods they donâ€™t need
//Interface with lot of functionalities cause lot of problems and it is called Fat interface
//Implementing classes  don't need to behave same like superclasses, just enough to follow syntactically
